                   <p>From birth till early childhood, Umesh had a normal weight, despite the fact he was never into active extra curriculars. But, as he reached the age of 10, his weight drastically began to take over his body. With no active activity in his life, he spent most of his time studying, which has now paid off. But, as he continued to grow, his weight problem worsened, eventually threatening his overall health and wellbeing. When I was a child, he had a heavy coke influence which also contributed to his health. Eventually, around two years ago, Umesh decided that enough was enough. He was ready to work hard to get back in shape so that he could live a healthy life. This is his story and a few tips on how you can change your habbits and eating ways to live a better and healthier life!

                        <p>For the past 2 years, I have been on a journey of transformation. What started off as an exercise in weight loss turned into a total rest of my lifestyle. A big part of this reset was the transition to healthy eating. I have been a foodie all my life and living in South East Asia and traveling around the world exposed me to diverse cuisines and best food available on earth. It didn’t help that I was living in Thailand (possibly the culinary capital of South East Asia) and working for a French company (French food oh la la) and had colleagues who shared my passion for food. I have always been heavy all my life and also lost weight many times and gained back more than I had lost every time. But then a sedentary job with lots of travel, regular and copious amounts of eating out & no exercise led to my weight ballooning to 130 KG in May 2017. I had hardly any clothes left to wear and no where to buy new ones. The turning point came when I went to buy ski pants in Paris. Without even checking his stock, the store clerk looked at me and said “Sorry we don’t ‘ave your size.You must go to USA”. Not only was my Antarctica trip at risk (I couldn’t have done it without ski pants), I was also embarrassed beyond words. Walking back from that store in Paris, I decided that I wanted to change the way I lived. I decided to eat healthy, eat less and exercise more.</p>
                        <br>
                       
                            <p>The first job was to assess where I was, decide the goal and set a clear timeline to get there with timely checks along the way. I got a full blood work done and stood on the scale for the first time in many months. Thankfully my blood reports where completely normal. Barring a few minor deviations, blood sugar and blood pressure, the leading indicators of chronic illness were within normal limits. My biggest problem was my weight, which had touched 130 kg, the highest it had ever been. With the thought ‘when you’re on top, the only way to go is down’, I began my journey on 1st of June 2017.</p>
                            <br>
                               
                               <p>The first change to be made was around food. I have always loved Michael Pollan’s writings about food and my favourite book is ‘Food Rules’. I love the way he has simplified the road to healthy eating. The entire book is based on the rule ‘Eat (real) food, mostly plant based, not too much’. He has further elaborated 7 rules, but the ones relevant to me are listed below and also how I interpreted them and used them in my journey:</P>
                                   <br>
                               <ol>
                               <li>don’t eat anything with more than five ingredients, or ingredients you can't pronounce - I interpreted this as - cook your own food and minimise ingredients</li>
                               <li>Shop for real food that is usually sold at the perimeter of the supermarket - I started buying my own vegetables and choosing something different every time. More about this later.</li> 
                               <li>"Always leave the table a little hungry," - for me, this meant portion control. I bought a weighing scale for home and office. I decided (almost arbitrarily) that I needed to have a meal that weighed about 250gm and had a mix of carb + veggies + protein in equal measure.</li>
                           </ol>
                               <br>
                               
                               In addition to Michael Pollan’s, I made a few of my own rules. These included:
                               <ol>
                               <li>having a balance of carbohydrates, protein, fibre in a standard mix for every meal.</li> 
                               <li>Having a colourful meal everyday, making sure even the carbohydrate colour changed regularly.</li> 
                               <li>Not compromising on my meal pattern just because I had to eat out for an official or social dinner.</li>
                               <li>to have 3 meals a day but compulsorily having lunch and if time didn’t permit, skipping dinner.</li>
                               <li>Eliminating all snacks from the house and the office.</li>
                               </ol>
                       <br>
                               
                               <p>I went from carrots and cabbage to baby corn and kailan, to aubergine and unknown Indonesian leafy vegetables. There was always something new from the vegetable section in my trolley. For protein, I stuck to lean chicken but also tried fish sometimes. And then I discovered tofu and tempe.</p>
                               
                               
                               <p>I also began to exercise everyday. I have 2 dogs and they need to be walked at least twice a day. I began waking up at 4:00 every morning and taking the dogs for a nice 60 to 90 min walk.</p>
                               
                               <p>My body transformation began almost immediately. The first 5 kg are always easiest to lose and they fell off within the first 2 weeks. By week 6 I had already received my first question abruptly during a meeting - hey have you lost weight? I started feeling more motivated as the trousers started feeling less tight. In spite of sleeping less, eating less and exercising more, I was feeling greatly energised. I loved sticking to my food plan with zealous discipline. It won me even more admiration from colleagues and business partners, especially when they saw me pull out my tupperware on a fancy dinner table laden with delicious food. I recall a dinner with the French and EU ambassador. When the food was served and everyone said bon appetit, I pulled out my dinner box and on being asked, explained what it contained. The rest of my story was completed by my colleagues and it received complements and hurrahs from everyone around the table. These kind of events only steeled my resolve even further.</p> 
                               
                               <p>It is now exactly 2 years since the journey began and I have lost a total of 30 kg. Along the way, I experimented with giving up coffee, turning vegan, intermittent fasting and many different types of exercise. It has been a very rewarding journey to say the least. I am still at least 15 kg away from my destination. My target weight is 85 KG. I must admit that my discipline has waxed and waned over time. I am still very conscious of what I eat but the militancy with which I followed my eating pattern has declined. I am also exercising lesser than I was before. I need to change that. I need to get back into the same militancy with which I was doing things before. Maybe this anniversary will be a good excuse for me to do that.</p>
